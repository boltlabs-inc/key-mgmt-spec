# Contributing
To contribute to the specification, please refer to the following guidelines.

## Writing Guidelines

1. Describe the problem by defining one or more tasks in a GitHub issue(s). A large task should be labelled as an "epic" and linked to subissues, if any. Issues MUST state the problem to be solved and outline the requirements for marking a task complete. 
1. New text is precise and clearly written, and the specification is self-contained. Ask yourself the following questions:
    - Are there any points of ambiguity in the documentation? That is, is there a danger that an architect or developer will implement something different from what you intended? If so, either rephrase or include additional implementation guidance.
    - Are there precise definitions of all newly introduced terms?
    - Are there concise explanations of all newly introduced concepts? 
    - Are there additional references added to help a reader delve deeper into a newly introduced topic?    
1. Always work in a branch and create a pull request (PR) in order to merge to main. All commits/PR should be linked to the relevant issues:
    1. The description of the PR should include closing words for all issues that should be closed automatically by merging the given PR to main.
    1. Individual commits should include the issue number in commit messages for traceability.
1. Request a PR review. The changes MUST be reviewed by at least one person other than the initial writer. Be sure that all preceding criteria have been met before marking your PR as ready for review and requesting a review.
1. Respond to feedback and re-request a review, as appropriate.
1. Once approved, rebase and merge the PR(s).
